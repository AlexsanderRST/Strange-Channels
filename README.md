You are driving home when a strange salesman offers you a television at a price you can't refuse. During the night, 
you decide to install the TV and watch your favorite sitcom. However, few channels work, and they are strange. 
For unknown reason, some seem to be connected to each other.

For now, 10 channels and 1 puzzle are available.
